Introduces the Java programming language, basic object-oriented concepts, and simple graphical applications. If you have no prior computer programming background, then COMP 161 is the paper for you. It is a beginner's introduction to programming in the object-oriented Java language. We offer COMP 161 on campus in S1, and by distance in S2 and in a 'non-standard' period (N1 / Pre Christmas Summer School). COMP 161 occupies an important part in the computer science curriculum because it is normally required preparation for COMP 162 (which is a prerequisite for all 200-level Computer Science papers). Students with prior programming experience may sit an Advanced Placement Test for direct entry to COMP162.",
