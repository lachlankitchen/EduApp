We follow the migratory journeys of Pacific peoples, who colonised islands from southeast Asia, through the tropical Pacific, southward to Aotearoa. These journeys represent the greatest maritime migration in human history, covering a third of the surface of the globe. During the course we will outline the sequence of human settlement and the subsequent development of regional cultures, examining some of the major issues in contemporary Pacific archaeological research.Topics covered include the voyaging and exploration strategies leading to island discovery and settlement; the development of Pacific economies and social systems; and how these were transformed during the colonisation of ever more remote islands. We will also examine the effects of human colonisation on Pacific environments, including landscape modifications, introductions of new plants and animals, and extinctions.",

We also examine the Pacific's history of indentured labour and forced migration, the impacts of which are still being felt today. Gender issues in the contemporary Pacific will be a recurring theme throughout this paper, and we will consider how contemporary globalisation impacts upon a variety of women and their family structures.We use selected case studies drawn from various national identities and ethnicities in order to explore their relationship with human rights, military bases, resources, poverty, gendered violence and resilience.",

Thus we interrogate concepts such as 'power', 'culture', 'politics' and 'anthropology', and students will pursue a research essay that investigates some of the local meanings attached to these terms in contemporary Aotearoa/New Zealand, Australia, Asia or the wider Pacific with specific case studies of several such intersections of 'culture' and 'power'.

Exploration of the commodification, medicalisation, moralities and aesthetics of embodied health via a research essay.

During the semester we will develop ideas about the nature of health, suffering (both individual and structural), the anthropological meaning behind terms such as healing and curing, and the variety of ways in which people experience embodied selfhood from a diverse array of cultural perspectives.We will also study the complex varieties of health care workers and carers in any local situation and the ideological relationships between health and notions of commerce, aesthetics, morality and identity. In doing so we will attempt to develop a cross-cultural meaning of the complex and taken for granted concept of health.To successfully achieve this goal, we must also critically examine the dominant local model of health in New Zealand, which is represented by a local and culturally specific version of cosmopolitan (or Western bio-) medicine. The approach through which we will conduct this task is known as critical interpretive medical anthropology and is based on a political economy approach to the study of health and illness complemented with insights from phenomenological anthropology.This paper is taught in yearly rotation with ANTH 322.",

The aim of this course is to assist students in developing a broad understanding of fisheries ecology and population biology of exploited species. In particular students will develop an understanding of the evolutionary origins of fish, life history strategies, ecology, population biology and management of exploited species. Students will develop a working knowledge of approaches to management of exploited species. The course aims to help develop an appreciation of the interaction between science and management, and the role of science in decision-making. To this end many of the practical exercises will be \"problem focused\" and use local case studies to highlight how information on fish can be used. Particular attention will be given to fisheries at the ecosystem scale and the growing need for conservation in these systems.",

Have you ever stopped to wonder at how easy it is, given you have the cash or credit, to go out and buy almost anything you want? How is it that such a wide range of goods and services are produced in roughly the right amounts, often at surprisingly low cost, and then distributed to the people who want them?This paper builds an understanding of how, and how well, our market-oriented economy gets this done. We use a variety of simple yet revealing graphical models to study the mechanics of markets and the market system and to evaluate market outcomes. We identify factors that can inhibit markets functioning and evaluate public policies used to counteract these inhibitors, both in individual markets and in the macro economy. In particular, we study issues around international trade, business strategy, competition policy, the environment, taxation, and cycles in exchange, interest, unemployment and growth rates.",

The time value of money, calculations of fair value for bonds and stocks, criteria for financing a business, risk-return trade-offs, regulatory frameworks and ethical considerations are included. This paper introduces students to business finance with a primary focus on the principles of financial valuation. We first discuss the concept of time value of money together with looking at how we can apply these valuation techniques to making personal investment decisions. Since decision making with investments virtually always involves risk (uncertainty), we will then introduce the concept of risk and the relation between risk and return. This is followed by a discussion of the cost of financing and how that, as integrated with cash flows, will impact on the valuation outcome and decision making at a corporate level. We close the paper looking at the relevance of capital structure and dividend policy in corporate performance.",

In New Zealand, income per capita is US$37,800; virtually everyone can read and write; and, on average, people can expect to live for 81 years. In India, income per capita is US$1,600; about a third of the population cannot read and write; and average life expectancy is 68 years. Most of the countries that make up the world economy have more in common with India than with New Zealand. These countries (where more than two thirds of the world's population live) are known as the \"Third World\". Other names for this group of countries include \"developing countries\" and \"less-developed countries (LDCs)\".This paper is about the economies of these countries. We will analyse why it is that most of the world's economies appear to be trapped at low standards of living for most of their citizens. We will also ask what policies, if any, are likely to encourage the economic development of these countries. The approach followed will be to relate the theoretical literature to the real-world experience.",

One topic is competition policy, which covers government policy in relation to mergers and other potentially anti-competitive behaviour. Another topic is the regulation of natural monopolies, including the electricity and telecommunications industries. Further, topics on social regulation such as health, safety and environmental regulation will also be covered.This paper examines the ways governments could intervene to address market failures. You will learn about key policy issues through the language of neoclassical economic theory, behavioural economics, vivid real-world examples and research processes that generate major empirical findings. Topics will vary according to student interest, but will include government policies to promote competition, the regulation of natural monopolies and social regulation. Students will be introduced to the kind of real-world issues about government policy that are dealt with by economic consultancy firms and government agencies.",

Specifically, we will develop a working understanding of the economics of urban areas:Economic explanations of why cities exist, where they develop and why they growHow and why urban land develops in some consistent patternsThe roles of local governments in influencing the allocation of resources in urban areas",

It is not difficult to find violations of each of these precepts in real-world economic behaviour, and the study of the \"limits to rationality\" has become a vibrant and rapidly growing field within economics.

    "description": "A paper aimed at preparing Honours students for independent study in macroeconomics. The main topics covered will be the AS/AD paradigm, new classical macroeconomics, monetary and fiscal theory and policy. I want this to be a paper where students learn about modern macroeconomic methods, but also apply them and foster skills such as academic writing and giving a presentation. The last couple of years have been exciting years for macroeconomists. The subprime mortgage crisis and the following Great Recession resuscitated the interest in macroeconomic questions and policies. In this paper we will study those questions using state-of-the-art macroeconomic models. What are the effects of monetary and fiscal policy? Should we be concerned about government debt levels? How does quantitative easing work? How does a bank run work and how can we increase financial stability? Macroeconomics over the recent past also focuses on topics such as inequality and the impacts of climate change. Macroeconomic theory has changed dramatically over the last decades. Academic publications and policy institutions (central banks, the Treasury, ...) use models based on microeconomic foundations. Those models are mathematically quite sophisticated. Nevertheless, the basic intuition embedded in those models can be exposited by drawing on diagrams and \"old generation\" models.Roughly speaking, the course is divided into three main parts. I try to relate to real world events as often as possible. In the first part, we will have a look at important macroeconomic time series topics and then focus on building intuitive macroeconomic models and analyse monetary and fiscal policy measures in the closed- and open-economy framework. The second part provides a microfoundation of household and firm optimal behaviour. Then, we will combine those two sides of the market and build a stylised general equilibrium model, the workhorse model of macroeconomic research used in central banks and academia, the Real Business Cycle model. Finally, part three considers fiscal policy, government debt, details of monetary policy-making, and discusses models of the Global Financial Crisis.",

Or perhaps you've wondered how children's rights and agency can actually be promoted through their education engagement? Are you curious about how societies and cultures construct their ideas about learning, curriculum and assessment?In this paper you will engage in cooperative learning experiences with others to investigate and make meaning of the contested terrain of young children's learning and explore how various issues and contexts enhance and constrain the learning of young children in their earliest years.",

Most of the writing we encounter on a daily basis is not what we traditionally think of as 'literature' (fiction, drama, poetry), but rather what we rather unconvincingly call 'non-fiction'. This is writing that is intended to inform and explain, amuse and argue, describe and persuade; and whilst such writing is often 'professional' (rather than 'creative'), we often overlook the obvious fact that the best of it is read for the same reason as literature: that is, for pleasure. This paper will focus on the rhetoric of prose and on writing (and reading) in the range of non-fiction genres, including travel writing, profiles, argument and polemic, autobiographical reflection, social and political commentary and reviews (books, film, music, etc.). That being said, students have a great deal of choice about their precise subject matter.

    "description": "Focuses on the psychological dimensions of prominent literary texts. Canvasses the complex relationship between literature and psychology from a broad range of perspectives. While literature is inherently interdisciplinary, the relationship between literature and psychology is perhaps particularly intimate. Reading takes us into the minds of characters, and these characters - like the humans upon whom they are modelled - frequently face a range of psychological challenges. In response, they may develop characterological adaptations that can generate problems in psychological functioning - problems that affect not just the characters themselves, but also those with whom they stand in relation.In this paper, we read a range of literary texts with a view to understanding - both analytically and empathetically - some of these problems and adaptions, as well the changing ways in which they have been addressed by the clinical profession. Thus the paper begins with a critical analysis of the treatment of \"madness\" via conventional psychiatric institutions, before turning to the power of psychoanalysis in addressing questions such as trauma, narcissism, and impaired forms of relationality. Further, instead of simply considering these \"pathologies\" the property of individuals, the paper adopts a psychosocial lens to emphasise the broader social dimensions underpinning maladapted psychological formations, as well as their (frequently unconscious) transgenerational transmission. It concludes with a reflection on the little or big \"madnesses\" that may lie hidden within the very fabric of what is considered to be \"sane\" and \"normal\" in Western society.At the end of this paper, students will have greater awareness of, and be able to reflect more deeply about, the psychological dimenions at work in literary texts and sociocultural discourses more broadly.",

The paper challenges the popular perception of medieval women as subordinate, to reveal women who subverted authority, and men who supported their cause.Paper structure:The paper is structured into two sections: the first examines texts written by women in the Middle Ages, and the second examines texts written by men about women in the Middle Ages:Texts written by women:In this section we read texts by Christine de Pizan and learn about her very public quarrel with the French literary establishment and their antifeminist portrayal of women. We read the trial records of Christine's contemporary, Joan of Arc, before she is sentenced and burned at the stake. We examine the letters of Margaret Paston and her family to learn about everyday life for medieval women. We examine works from Julian of Norwich and Margery Kemp, that reveal how women undermined the authority of the church.Texts written by men about women:In this section we learn about how medieval men wrote about women, particularly using the 'good woman' trope that Geoffrey Chaucer exploited but also undermined in The Legend of Good Women and in the Wife of Bath. We examine poems such as The Nine Ladies Worthy, The Flower and the Leaf, and The Assembly of Ladies, which show different ways of responding to the antifeminist tradition in male-authored literature. Finally, we finish with the most offensive or humorous (depending on your perspective) text, Giovanni Boccaccio's Il Corbaccio, about the evils of women.",

For students who plan a professional career in financial markets, it will serve as a collection of state-of-the-art findings of scientific inquiry that can be utilised in real/professional life. While these two functions are separate, we will strive to combine them as I am a strong believer in combining theory, research and practice. We will have a very comprehensive coverage of the research published in high-quality academic journals on the following topics: asset pricing, return predictability and market efficiency, foreign exchange markets, the interaction between the real economy and financial markets, market microstructure, behavioural finance and a number of smaller topics.The topics will be logically linked together, so it will not be reading randomly-selected papers. The paper builds on a good level of understanding of financial markets concepts and terminology and econometrics/statistics, which are prerequisites of this paper.

In relation to each debate, we ask what it means to explore the links between larger intellectual or political ideas and more intimate, personal domains. Each year in this paper we examine two or three debates in the study of gender and sexuality. Our approach is interdisciplinary, drawing from gender studies, sociology, political theory, history, textual analysis, anthropology, philosophy and beyond.Section One explores key debates in gender and sexuality with a focus on language. We will explore how legal narratives both reflect and construct normative gender roles. We will also explore how narrative and metaphor can be used to challenge and trouble normative boundaries, and how digital media offers new mechanisms for both the policing of and resistance to traditional gender representations.Section Two explores the intersections between historical and sociological literature on sexuality, with a focus on social constructionism and lived experience. We explore the sexual archive, and its affective aspects: what does it mean to explore the complexities of sexuality, and how does it relate to feeling and emotion?",

All topics, including the detailed study of weather systems and climate change, are described in a New Zealand weather and climate context.",

GEOG 401 is one of three required papers in the 180 point, 12 month Coursework Master of International Development and Planning. In this course, we examine the many strands of development theory and how they have changed across time and space. While initially development theory focused on how ex-colonies, or the developing world, could modernize and replicate the experience of the Western world, in the contemporary era there are now a whole range of different theoretical perspectives that we can use to understand the experiences and aspirations of people living in low and middle income countries. Contemporary global challenges include issues of inequality, environmental sustainability and empowerment. In this course, we focus on case studies that examine the role of development theory from the perspective of gender, expert knowledge, participation and environmental management among other debates.

A minimum of two supervisors are required. In some instances, a third co-supervisor may be appropriate. Students are responsible for seeking out potential supervisors and reaching initial agreement. Supervisory arrangements are then formally approved by the programme Convenor or Research Team through the 'research proposal approval' process. Paper Structure HASC 590 begins with the student identifying the topic they want to research and finding qualified and available supervisors. A research proposal is prepared (in consultation with the supervisors) and submitted for approval. Where relevant, ethical approval may also be required before data collection can begin.Once the proposal is approved, the student undertakes the project as outlined in the proposal. Regular meetings with the supervisors are expected, and may be either online or in-person, depending on departmental requirements. 'Milestones' are usually established and discussed with supervisors to monitor the progress of the research and draft manuscripts. The final dissertation (of up to 20,000 words) is submitted for examination by two independent examiners. Examiners are nominated by the supervisor and approved by the Convenor and the Division. Examiners submit their recommendations to the Convenor; the Convenor determines the final result. Teaching Arrangements The Distance Learning offering of this paper is a combination of remote and in-person teaching.A Supervision Memorandum of Understanding (establishing responsibilities, expectations, timelines, etc for both student and supervisor) is to be prepared at the beginning of the dissertation project. Textbooks Research resources will vary depending on the research involved and should be discussed with the supervisors. Graduate Attributes Emphasised Scholarship, Critical thinking, Ethics, Research, Self-motivation.View more information about Otago's graduate attributes.

It does so through examining three interrelated sets of questions.Why adopt \"democracy\" as a means of resolving issues of disagreement amongst the members of society, and why does this method of rule making justify the imposition of that rule upon those who may disagree with it?In light of New Zealand's general commitment to democratic decision making, how does the law then shape and condition our parliamentary election process? What legal rules govern matters such as who may vote, who may they vote for, how election campaigns may be conducted, how electoral winners and losers are identified, and so on? Why do we have these particular legal rules in place, and are they appropriate or adequate?Once the election process has identified the members of New Zealand's Parliament, how does this institution go about making law for the country as a whole? What legal rules constrain this lawmaking process? What other forms of control apply to it? How can interested parties involve themselves in that process in an attempt to influence its outcome?Therefore, the course combines some legal theory with an in-depth study of New Zealand's electoral laws and the various rules that govern how Parliament operates as a lawmaking body.",

International management is the leadership of integration of functional business areas within an international environment. The overall function of the various internal assessments is formative (targeted at learning) rather than summative (for grading purposes).The prescription of a mixture of didactic and case methods will ensure that students develop problem-solving skills that will become features of their life-long learning.Given that this is a second-year paper, it is expected that you will be in large part responsible for your own learning. Giving and receiving constructive feedback is an essential part of formative learning and being a manager. Hence it is considered important in this classroom.",

Theory and practice are contextualised internationally. In line with the growing demand for graduates to be able to demonstrate attributes like communication competence, critical thinking and lifelong learning skills, this paper is designed to increase your understanding of capabilities in communicating in interpersonal, international and intercultural situations.Understanding informs good communication. Understanding is made up of two parts: cultural awareness, or how another person's culture affects his or her communicative behaviour, and self-awareness, or an understanding of how our own culture and personal dispositions affect our communication practices. Communication competence in everyday business, and life itself, is a mix of interpersonal and intercultural skills and understanding. One area of focus, given a business context, is face-to-face interactions; another is virtual interaction skills.The paper is divided into distinct components that allow for a profound understanding of \"why\" and then a more practical situation in which you will be able to develop and explore what constitutes communication competence, \"the how\".",

The paper will be structured around a new venture case, and will develop understandings of the issues related to starting a new business. This paper will unpack fundamental concepts for generating and implementing novel, useful ideas within new and existing ventures. Individuals, teams, and firms are pursuing entrepreneurship in increasing numbers with the hope of becoming their own boss, achieving financial rewards, scratching their own \"itch\", and creating products and services to enhance peoples' lives. MANT 303 facilitates in-depth understanding of the two fundamental dimensions of entrepreneurship: opportunity identification and opportunity execution.The paper is an introductory course intended to provide students with knowledge of entrepreneurship and the vital role played by entrepreneurs in the global economy. To achieve this, this paper focuses on the creation of new ventures, the skills necessary for success in an entrepreneurial venture and factors associated with new venture success.Entrepreneurship can be both a science and a practice, and this is reflected in the paper's dual emphasis. You will be constantly challenged to apply theory within real-world settings through exemplar cases, interaction with invited speakers, development of a new business opportunity, teamwork, and individual study.The paper may appeal to students who wish to launch their own venture or pursue entrepreneurship within an existing firm. It will also be valuable to those seeking work within an existing start-up, venture capital firm, or professional consultancy.

For each group we will focus first on biodiversity; explore the physiological, ecological and behavioural solutions they have evolved; and discuss the conservation issues they face in the modern world. We will take time to explore the oddities: for example, fish that use electrical pulses to navigate or have parasitic males whose only function is to fertilise females; seasnakes whose venom is as deadly as that of all but the most dangerous land snakes; sea birds that fly underwater; and whales that make the loudest and most complicated acoustic signals in the animal kingdom.",

    "description": "An introduction to the basic analytical and critical skills as they apply to the study of moving images, specifically film. Issues of form, style and genre are addressed. Moving images surround us, they are part of our daily routine and our lifetime experience, we no longer simply encounter them when we go to the cinema, instead they are on our phones and our laptops, we see them in our city streets and around airports. In this course we explore how screen studies has conceptualised relations between viewers and moving images. Key concepts to be covered include: narrative and spectacle, the cinematic apparatus, the gaze, entertainment and pleasure, ideology and advertising, censorship and the regulation of image culture, broadcasting and narrowcasting, audience research and media effects debates.The course divides in two; in the first section on \u2018screen form\u2019 we focus on narrative and fictional moving images: feature and short films, experimental media, adverts and web series. In the second section \u2018screen culture\u2019 our focus is upon the social and cultural questions raised by media. We are interested in the wider permutations of screens, and we take in television in both its traditional terrestrial and digital, multi-platform incarnations.A core focus of this paper is upon introducing you to the construction of critical argument. The three forms of assessment: Journal Exercises; the making of an Audio-Visual Essay and the Critical Essay are designed to support this focus.In previous years students found the best aspect of the paper was:Looking closely at the films we watched during the film screeningsThe video essay, as a great way of providing a thesisThe lectures on censorship, mythical meanings and the male gazeWorking with other students and tutorsLearning how to edit in Da Vinci Resolve",

The notion of the film director as author has long been a central theoretical and historical issue within cinema studies. Film authorship has been crucially important both to film studies and the film industry itself in the last several decades. This paper will study the ways authorship has been theorised; its impact on the New Hollywood cinema of the late 1960s to the present; and the work of a selection of contemporary American directors as authors. Students will leave the paper with a greater understanding of film history and the work of the film director. It is ideal for MFCO majors, humanities students, students who wish to work in any part of the film industry and any student interested in contemporary cinema.",

Conflicts begin in human minds - therefore, understanding conflict requires the understanding of the influence of social-psychological dynamics. In this paper we will focus on social psychological concepts of intergroup conflict, such as identity and collective memory, and inquire as to how they propel groups towards conflict. We will also consider how understanding these processes can help prevent and resolve conflicts. The paper will involve lectures, discussions and reading materials.We will take an academic approach to these subjects, studying them through the critical scholarly lens offered from empirical and theoretical research. As these concepts aim to explain intergroup conflicts, which are multi-layered phenomena often appearing at the macro-level of society, we will discuss the boundaries of each concept and the challenges of how to study them appropriately.Overall the paper has three objectives:To expose you to a broad sample of the research and theory that exists on intergroup conflict and conflict resolution.To raise your awareness of the special issues involved in performing research in this area, due to the sensitive nature of many of the topics, as well as the complex nature of the phenomena being studied. In some cases, simple laboratory experiments with college students yield reliable and valid results. In many others, a more extensive research paradigm is required.To train you to read academic papers about complex phenomena, using a social psychological lens, and to apply it to investigate intergroup conflicts.",

This is a paper straddling metaethics (the nature and justification of moral judgements), the history of philosophy and the philosophy of logic. It deals with three themes from the work of David Hume (1711-1776) together with \"matters arising\" from the Humean agenda:The Slavery of Reason Thesis (\"reason is and ought only to be the slave of the passions\"). What does this mean? Is the Slavery of Reason Thesis (or something like it) correct? And what (if anything) does this suggest about the nature of ethics?The Motivation (or Influence) Argument:Morals have an influence on the actions and affections. [Premise]Reason alone, as we have already proved, can never have any such influence. [Premise]Morals...cannot be derived from reasonWhat exactly is this argument supposed to prove? Does it succeed? If not, is there a decent argument in the neighbourhood that proves something similar? Can it be used to support non-cognitivism, the idea that moral judgements are neither true nor false?Hume's No-Ought-From-Is thesis: \"[It] seems altogether inconceivable\", says David Hume, \"that this new relation or affirmation [ought] can be a deduction from others, which are entirely different from it\". What did Hume mean by this? Can you deduce an ought from an is? If not, why not? And what (if anything) does this suggest about the status of moral judgements? We focus on the idea, common in the 18th century, that logic is conservative - that in a valid inference you cannot get out what you haven't put in. In a famous paper the great New Zealand logician Arthur Prior challenged No-Ought-From-Is, along with the concept of conservativeness. We discuss the responses of Pigden, Schurz, Greg Restall and Gillian Russell, who all try to vindicate different versions of No-Ought-From-Is in the face of Prior's counterexamples.",

    "description": "This course explores the \u2019Why be Moral?\u2019 question in Philosophy and Literature through the work of Plato, Wilde, Dostoevsky, Laclos and Shakespeare. \"Why be Moral?\" is a question that dates back to Plato. Some suppose that morality is socially necessary, a culturally evolved device that counteracts our nasty natures and allows us to \"get along\". Others believe that morality is pernicious since it serves as an excuse for cruelty and a prop to predatory elites. I reply that society would be better off believing in a sane and humane morality than none at all (though we would be better off believing in no morality rather than - say - the morality of the Nazis).But even if a sensible and humane morality is socially necessary, why should I, the individual, subscribe to the myth? Or if morality is not a myth, why should I do the right thing if the wrong thing would pay better?

    "description": "What is morality good for? And why should I do right if doing wrong would pay better? Plato, Laclos, Dostoevsky and Shakespeare help answer these questions. \"Why be Moral?\" is a question that dates back to Plato. Some suppose that morality is socially necessary - a culturally evolved device that counteracts our nasty natures and allows us to \"get along\". Others believe that morality is pernicious since it serves as an excuse for cruelty and a prop to predatory elites. I reply that society would be better off believing in a sane and humane morality than none at all (though we would be better off believing in no morality rather than - say - the morality of the Nazis). But even if a sensible and humane morality is socially necessary, why should I, the individual, subscribe to the myth? Or if morality is not a myth, why should I do the right thing if the wrong thing would pay better? I reply, using examples drawn from literature, that the life of an amoralist would tend to be emotionally empty.Another anti-moral claim is the idea - preached by Hegel, Nietzsche and (perhaps) by Machiavelli - that some people, \"Napoleons\" or \"great men\", have the right to transcend the ordinary bounds of right and wrong.

    "description": "This paper deals with three themes from David Hume and discusses their consequences for contemporary meta-ethics: The Slavery of Reason Thesis; The Motivation Argument; Hume\u2019s No-Ought-From-Is thesis. This is a paper straddling metaethics (the nature and justification of moral judgements), the history of philosophy and the philosophy of logic. It deals with three themes from the work of David Hume (1711-1776) together with \"matters arising\" from the Humean agenda:The Slavery of Reason Thesis (\"reason is and ought only to be the slave of the passions\"). What does this mean? Is the Slavery of Reason Thesis (or something like it) correct? And what (if anything) does this suggest about the nature of ethics?The Motivation (or Influence) Argument:Morals have an influence on the actions and affections. [Premise]Reason alone, as we have already proved, can never have any such influence. [Premise]Morals...cannot be derived from reasonWhat exactly is this argument supposed to prove? Does it succeed? If not, is there a decent argument in the neighbourhood that proves something similar? Can it be used to support non-cognitivism, the idea that moral judgements are neither true nor false?Hume's No-Ought-From-Is thesis: \"[It] seems altogether inconceivable\", says David Hume, \"that this new relation or affirmation [ought] can be a deduction from others, which are entirely different from it\". What did Hume mean by this? Can you deduce an ought from an is? If not, why not? And what (if anything) does this suggest about the status of moral judgements? We focus on the idea, common in the 18th century, that logic is conservative - that in a valid inference you cannot get out what you haven't put in. In a famous paper the great New Zealand logician Arthur Prior challenged No-Ought-From-Is, along with the concept of conservativeness. We discuss the responses of Pigden, Schurz, Greg Restall and Gillian Russell, who all try to vindicate different versions of No-Ought-From-Is in the face of Prior's counterexamples.",

This paper explores key debates regarding the nature and purpose of planning and develops students' understanding of the influence of theory on the development of planning practice. Students examine the relationship between theory and practice, the theoretical developments that have shaped and continue to shape planners' thinking and approaches. It examines key theories within the context of both the historical and contemporary developments in planning, exploring the debates these raise in planning within the planning profession.Content includes: Planning theories, history of urban development, and global planning across different countries. Planning approaches, power, politics, neoliberalism and collaborative planning. Urban development internationally including gentrification, regeneration, green and post human cities. Planning for people, social justice, planning for difference and issues of equity. The future of planning in a changing world. The paper, therefore, asks students to consider the roots of planning thought and practice and their application to current planning dilemmas and debates both locally and globally.",

But such relations cannot be understood in isolation from the context of the international system where they are formed.The focus, therefore, will be on the rise and decline of the bi-polar system, the emergence of the new post-Cold War order and the persistence of certain international issues throughout the period in question.

This will include more mainstream ideologies, such as those of liberalism, nationalism and conservatism; those that have been gaining increasing prominence in contemporary politics, such as populism, feminism and ecologism, and those which have had important \u2013 and potentially recurring \u2013 historical importance, such as fascism, communism and anarchism.

    "description": "Examines selected global health problems in order to deepen understanding of epidemiological concepts and to review current knowledge about the distribution, determinants and prospects for control of these conditions. This paper provides a population perspective on selected health issues and considers the relative importance of these problems in New Zealand and globally. It also highlights the importance of reliable evidence to the effective control of major health problems. On completion of the paper, students will be in a better position to make a constructive and knowledgeable contribution to discussions about health and healthcare-related issues. For instance, students will be better equipped to assess published literature, media reports and other sources of health information and to judge their accuracy and relevance. Moreover, by considering how knowledge about various health conditions has evolved, students will have a basis for assessing new information as it emerges in the future.PUBH 211 can be taken as a stand-alone paper, as part of a minor in Public Health or as part of a major in Public Health in the Bachelor of Health Sciences.",

Perhaps a quarter of the world's population can be described as either Hindu or Buddhist, and many more live in cultures that have been deeply influenced by these religious traditions over the past two-to-three thousand years. However, to many people, Hinduism and Buddhism remain exotic, unfamiliar faiths. What do Hindus do? Who was the Buddha? Why are there so many deities? What is enlightenment? This paper explores these questions and many others. We will examine the ways in which Hinduism and Buddhism are intertwined with Asian culture, society and history, and we will ask questions about the relationships between Asian religions and 'the West'. In studying these religions, we look closely at myths and rituals, texts and cosmologies, devotion and meditation, gods and goddesses, heavens and hells, morality and transgression, reality and rebirth, suffering and ultimate liberation.",

    "description": "A survey of major theories and writings on the evolution of religion. Provides an introduction to the methods appropriate to the study of ancient texts. Rituals and supernatural beliefs exist in nearly all known human societies, and across cultures religions are structurally quite similar. The universality and shared structure of religions beg evolutionary investigation. It is thus, perhaps, unsurprising that evolutionary approaches to the study of religion have flourished in recent years and continue to inspire considerable work. Efforts to apply Darwinian theory to the study of religion, however, do not represent a single unified endeavour or research program. This paper serves as an introduction to the contemporary evolutionary study of religion. Students will read major works from each of the three main theoretical approaches to the evolutionary study of religion (byproduct theories, group selection theories, and adaptationist theories) and will gain familiarity with the key points of disagreement between proponents of each approach. Students will also gain exposure to new and exciting empirical work in this growing research area.",

This comprehensive paper focuses on the craft, commerce, and culture of storytelling as the cornerstone of effective science communication, whether in film, writing, podcasting or exhibitions. Students will engage in a variety of exercises and assignments designed to flex the creative muscle and build sound proficiency in the art of telling compelling science stories that brim with action, emotion, and life. Along the way, we will engage in online conversations to glean practical wisdom from professional \u201csciencetellers\u201d who weave stories into their work in impactful and often surprising ways.",

These include theoretical approaches to modernity, social power, inequality, capitalism and social control. The idea of modernity is one of the core concepts in a sociological view of the world. Alongside its companion \u2018big idea\u2019 - capitalism - theories about modernity and the rationalisation of the world since the late-1700s have been central to sociological accounts of how contemporary society took shape, has a particular character, and generates particular kinds of problems for its citizens.This course introduces students to the sociology of modernity and will focus on five key dynamics that are central to the operation of power in modernist societies:Rationalisation of society, knowledge and economy during modernityBureaucratisation of government and the use of bureaucratic systems to control citizensIncreased individualisation along with a loss of traditional community lifeIncreased levels and new forms of social and political control in societyEmerging new ways of resisting modernityThe course will examine the emergence of these dynamics as they have taken shape in the formation of: new ways of thinking, new social/political institutions and new economic worlds in \u2018modern\u2019 societies. The course will then examine the way in which each of these dynamics has resulted in a particular kind of lived experience of modernity, as well as how these dynamics have increasingly been contested and disrupted to enable the emergence of \u2018post-modern\u2019 social worlds.Case studies elaborating these dynamics of modernity will examine topics like:The emergence of the modern state and bureaucratic modes of governing modern citizensPathologies of the state and the rise of authoritarianismContemporary economic dynamics of \u2018McDonaldisation\u2019The designing of the modern city - and its collapseThe collapse of community and rise of individualismThe role of science in the modernist worldThe clash between modernity and ecology",

We understand our present experiences by tracing our whakapapa through history, to understand the relationships and interrelation between various peoples, entities and processes over time. We first survey some contemporary thinkers who describe forms of injustice, and then we attempt to imagine some of the contours of what social justice might look like and how it might be reached. We then develop a detailed whakapapa of colonisation, of which globalisation is a recent aspect.

SOCI 403 is intended as the logical conclusion of the micro-sociology stream. The paper will build on ideas presented in SOCI 213 and SOCI 313, but is also intended as a stand-alone paper for students who have not completed those earlier papers. The theoretical approach in this paper will focus on the specific interface between the individual's experience of contemporary society on the one hand and the theoretical concepts of post-modernism/post-structuralism on the other hand. By situating SOCI 403 at this interface, it is intended that students will question the degree of agency individuals can experience in the face of forces for social conformity. With this in mind, the theory introduced will concentrate on the degree to which agency might be possible given the forces ranged against it. Virtual worlds will be used as cases to analyse an apparent paradoxical adherence to both individuality and conformity to socially generated ideals. To facilitate the development of thoroughgoing critical analysis, students will examine these ideas within specific socio-cultural contexts. Students will explore virtual reality/virtual world contexts with the intention of using these as a window to contemporary social issues surrounding agency and identity. The theoretical content of SOCI 403 will be taught using three themes, each of which provides a different perspective on self and identity. The themes are: subaltern identity/identities, the self vs ideology and hegemony, and gendered subjectivity/subjectivities in cyberspace and out of it. In the second half of the year student seminars will develop these three themes and address the application of the theoretical perspectives to the students' chosen case studies.",

The purpose of this paper is to explore the application of theory to social work practice in Aotearoa/New Zealand. The content covers theories and models that shape assessment and guide intervention at each of the three levels of the ecological model. This paper introduces the concept of practice frameworks, which allow for the integration of different theories and models in a coherent manner.Theories and models introduced during this paper will be critically evaluated in relation to culture, class, gender, age and ability. Given that many of these theories and models have been developed in other contexts, their relevance for practice in Aotearoa/New Zealand is explored. Students are also encouraged to evaluate these theories in relation to their own values. The material provided in lectures will be applied to case studies to provide students with the opportunity to explore the practical application of theory. Students will have the opportunity to critically evaluate theories and models from the perspective of their practical application and their own values. In the final assignment students will be required to develop their own framework for practice and apply this to their chosen case study.",

Case studies include youth justice, foster care, health (physical and mental), family violence, (dis)ability, and family support practice domains. An introduction to the main theoretical traditions informing the practice of social work in the Aotearoa/New Zealand context, their expression in social work methods, and the location of these theories and models within an overview of theoretical perspectives.This paper provides the foundation for the social work professional programme for both on-campus and distance students. It provides an overview of theory using the ecological model as a framework. The purpose of this paper is to explore the application of theory to social work practice in Aotearoa/New Zealand. The content covers theories and models that shape assessment and guide intervention at each of the three levels of the ecological model. This paper introduces the concept of practice frameworks, which allow for the integration of different theories and models in a coherent manner.Theories and models introduced during this paper will be critically evaluated in relation to culture, class, gender, age and ability. Given that many of these theories and models have been developed in other contexts, their relevance for practice in Aotearoa/New Zealand is explored. Students are also encouraged to evaluate these theories in relation to their own values. The material provided in lectures will be applied to case studies to provide students with the opportunity to explore the practical application of theory. Students will have the opportunity to critically evaluate theories and models from the perspective of their practical application and their own values. In the final assignment students will be required to develop their own framework for practice and apply this to their chosen case study.",

The history of land tenure change in New Zealand from pre-colonial times to the present, including M\u0101ori values in land, the Treaty of Waitangi, the M\u0101ori Land Court, the Waitangi Tribunal, and land related legislation. This paper is a core paper for the BSurv and BSc (Land Planning and Development), and it establishes a strong background for understanding the legal support for real property (land). SURV 206 provides an introduction to New Zealand's legal system, particularly as it affects land and property rights. It introduces M\u0101ori and colonial worldviews and the events leading to and including the Treaty of Waitangi, ceding sovereignty to the British Crown and confirming M\u0101ori rights in land and other taonga, an examination of the NZ wars and their relevance to land tenure. Colonial case law is examined to observe how M\u0101ori customary rights and the Treaty of Waitangi have been recognised in NZ law. 19th-century land legislation, including the Land Transfer Acts and the Native Lands Acts, are examined in order to understand the establishment of cadastral records and secure property rights in New Zealand.The paper examines the transfer of land and property from M\u0101ori to European settlers, the early land law of New Zealand, the history of settlement of New Zealand and land issues arising from all this legal history. The content will provide a clearer view of the background to many of the land and resource conflicts we see in current New Zealand society.",

    "description": "An introduction to the principles, methods and concepts of geographic information systems (GIS). The uses of spatial data for mapping, presenting, transforming and analysing information are emphasised. Geographic information systems (GIS) are being applied increasingly to a variety of human and natural problems that are too numerous and too diverse to list. Since spatial factors are central to almost all issues that involve the management and use of land and human occupancy, it is important that you develop a sound grasp of the principles of GIS and the means of applying it. As surveyors (geographers, planners, geologists, etc.), it is essential to understand the end uses of survey data as they are transformed from field collection into information and eventually into new knowledge. There is barely a single area of local and national government internationally that does not use spatial data of some form or another, and through this the spatial data and information, technology industries are among the fastest-growing in the world, with a multi-billion dollar market.In this paper, you will be introduced to the key concepts of GIS that are central to the uses of survey and other spatial data. These include technical concepts of data structures, use of ground co-ordinates and maps, and the integration of map data and tables of descriptive information linked to maps.",

In this way, the major aspects of GIS (analysis, storage, visualisation) are explored from a programmatic (Python) and algorithmic point of view.An important aspect to be introduced in this paper is the customisation of ArcGIS (i.e. adding extra functions) using programming - along with scripting, these are skills that can be adapted to make the most of the expanding open-source GIS world (e.g. QGIS). Programming for the web and geostatistical, 3D model and dynamic model scripting will also be examined. More specifically, the paper will cover spatial databases being used to store and manipulate different types of spatial data (e.g. point, line, polygon, grid cell features), as well as an algorithmic look at the some of the simpler spatial analysis and visualisation.

The emphasis in the supervision of the students is on their development as independent researchers and all the skills associated with this - only one part of which is the production of the final document. Recognising the close links between the academic study of tourism and the tourism industry and the benefits to both of theoretically informed research, TOUR 590 enables students to engage in projects that are either more academically or industry oriented, or a blending of the two. Consequently, all projects, irrespective of their specific nature, will be grounded in an awareness of relevant conceptual/theoretical debates and potential consequences for the tourism industry. Through their research project all students should be able to gain the skills necessary to successfully undertake a PhD or to work as researchers in the tourism industry.The blending of the applied and academic sides of tourism in TOUR 590 is a reflection of the teaching throughout the MTour programme, which recognises the benefits to students, academia and industry of fostering links between academia and industry. This is based on a view that all stakeholders benefit from a programme such as our MTour programme, which combines pathways for students seeking to go on to further study and those wishing to enhance their professional career in the industry.",

This paper illustrates that money is a profoundly cultural phenomenon, mediated by social, political and ideological forms that embody gendered practices of human agency and constraint, exchange, payment and consumption. As such the anthropology of money and its use says much about time, risk, faith, morality, trust and rationality. Exploring the cultural logics of money provides a critical perspective on the modern corporation, the power of numbers and their calculations, and the cross-cultural interpretation of capital.This paper begins by exploring the relationship between money and culture. This is then complemented with classic ethnographic studies of money and its juxtaposition between 'tradition' and 'modernity' and the displacement of 'special purpose money' by the 'great transformation'. We then turn our attention to stock markets, trading and traders, time, risk and its calculability, finance and the state, and the relationship between money and crime and money and gender, class, and development.",

The course considers when, where, and how the first Polynesians and their accompanying plants and animals were transferred from the tropics into the colder lands of temperate New Zealand as well as the impacts of those new arrivals on New Zealand's native fauna and flora. We explore the ways in which society, economy, ideology, patterns of settlement and exchange developed as Polynesians first colonised the diverse New Zealand islands, from the subtropical far north to the subpolar south. We then consider the archaeology of the more recent historical past in New Zealand. We examine changes in M\u0101ori culture, society and economy, and the arrival and the emergence of other cultural traditions during the 19th century.",

Failure to do so invariably results in cellular dysfunction and disease.BIOC 353 explores the biochemical and molecular basis of cell signalling pathways. Key pathways required for cellular function will be explored with an emphasis on the diversity of post translational modifications and protein interactions required to effect signals within cells. Pathways to be explored include those involved in growth and development, molecular trafficking, metabolic responses, cell death, inflammatory and oxidative stress responses. Throughout the course, examples of where defective cellular signalling results in disease including cancer, metabolic, neurodegenerative and some rarer diseases will be given.

Animals live in a hostile world where they must survive in the face of adverse weather and the presence of predators, find resources for body growth and fuel for their activities, and mate and rear their young, passing on genes to future generations. In overcoming the challenges, animals have developed a diversity of body plans, physiological adaptations and life styles. This introductory course surveys the evolution and diversity of animal life. It explores the unifying relationships between form and function among animals from different environments and how animals interact with each other and with their environment. Essential biological principles are illustrated by examples from the New Zealand fauna. Issues of environmental, social or economic importance and cutting-edge research developments at the University of Otago will be discussed.

The Fall of the Roman Empire is considered to be a watershed moment in Western history, marking an important conceptual division between the classical Mediterranean world and Medieval Europe. In fact, The Fall of Rome was not a single event, nor has anyone yet identified a single root cause for the Empire's demise. Instead, this was a drawn out process that spanned several centuries, across a period characterised by a long list of fascinating developments: the rise of Christianity, barbarian invasions, rampant corruption in the aristocratic classes, uncertainty in the imperial succession, an increasingly unstable financial system, the unpredictable actions of the Roman armies and the often seditious activities of ambitious military commanders.In this paper, we will explore the actual changes that took place in this dynamic period, which spans from circa 200 to 500 CE. Our analysis will rely on both the ancient written sources and on contemporary archaeological evidence as we reconstruct the effects of the Empire's fall on everyday life. Ongoing archaeological work in some of the important cities of the post-Roman Mediterranean allows us to develop a state-of-the-field perspective on the fall of the western Roman Empire and its impact on the people who lived in that world.",

In this paper we consider the archaeological evidence for that famous war, the poetic and historic versions of the tale as told by Homer and others, the story of the returns, including Odysseus, and some of the numerous ways in which artists in various media have engaged with events from Trojan War from late 6th century B.C.E. until the present day.",

Just about everything we do is impacted by a computer somewhere - whether it's flying, filing your tax return, going to the hospital, working on an assignment for university at home, surfing the internet, participating in an email exchange or a Skype conversation, or using your smartphone for whatever purpose. The list goes on and on.Because of the ubiquitous nature of this technology and the level to which it impacts each and every one of us, it becomes apparent that protecting the various aspects of computing is vital to the continuity and proper functioning of this technology. In fact there are not enough trained or qualified professionals to fill the constant need for those who are able to provide protective and defensive measures.That notwithstanding, protecting your own usage of computing entails knowledge of exactly what the threats are and how to mitigate those threats. Each of us must put measures in place to protect our own informational assets.COMP 210 Information Assurance (aka computer security) provides the student with a foundational understanding of what is at stake and how to defend and protect information assets, whether they be your own or those of the business you work in. This knowledge is really not optional - it is vital to the continuity of every computing service that each of us uses. In business it is an essential imperative.",

The North and South Islands of New Zealand are the two most-invaded islands by exotic plants in the world, and introduced or self-invaded animals are also exceptionally common. Students will be introduced to national and international examples of invasion ecology, by way of demonstrating classical examples, exceptions, cutting-edge understanding of ecosystem functions, and will be exposed to the practicalities of management, control and potential removal of invasive species in an ecosystem context. Through invited guest lectures and field trips, students will benefit from real-life experience of people on the front line of invasion ecology, and will have the opportunity to build relationships with individuals and institutions that can help foster their future careers.This new paper will complement the existing Ecology undergraduate papers, bringing together our aims of academic excellence and applied learning (teaching and learning through the process of doing research) in all Ecology papers, with opportunities for students to consider the practical and ethical aspects of work they are likely to be doing when employed as graduate-level ecologists. For non-ecologists, this paper will be a fascinating exploration of a topical issue.",

If you want to understand the forces at play in these situations, then you need to understand strategic interaction.No firm, government or person operates in a vacuum. The action that someone takes may not only have consequences for herself, but also for others, and vice versa. On the one hand we need to form beliefs about actions taken by others in order to know what action to choose oneself. On the other hand, we may influence decisions taken by others via our own decisions. That is, we engage in strategic thinking.

Mathematics is increasingly important in terms of the expression and communication of ideas in economics. So, a good knowledge of key mathematic techniques is indispensable for fully understanding almost all fields of economics.Advanced economics makes extensive use of formal mathematical models. This course covers the basic mathematical techniques required for rigorous study of economics, and it will provide extensive instruction on applications of these techniques to economic problems. Wherever possible, familiar micro and macro models will be used to place these tools in economic contexts. Examples and motivation are drawn from important topics in economics.",

The aim of this paper is to challenge students to think critically about curriculum. Te Wh\u0101riki has been an integral part of early childhood practice in this country for almost two decades. There is evidence to suggest that it has been influential in the development of other curriculum documents throughout the world. The sector has a sense of pride and ownership that the Aotearoa New Zealand curriculum has been seen as innovative. It is a curriculum that is strongly based on the rights of the child and seeks to empower children to be active learners and participants in their world.However, sometimes curriculum discourse can be taken for granted and become what Foucault would call a regime of truth. To avoid this happening we need to be constantly reflecting on Te Wh\u0101riki, considering and reconsidering whether there may be alternative approaches. Does the curriculum provide a basis for the weaving of exemplary practice? Does the curriculum create meaningful and relevant learning possibilities for all children? Does the curriculum fit the educational thinking of the 21st century? It is important you engage in ongoing dialogue and debate about appropriate curriculum.To assist in a critical reflection of Te Wh\u0101riki students will have an opportunity to explore and debate curriculum approaches that have been developed in Australia, the Asia/Pacific region, Britain and other countries of interest. The final debate will be: what could or should early childhood curriculum look like in this country in the 21st century?",

Develops an understanding of the relationships of art and artists to their historical and social settings. Allows students to explore and develop personal imagery in negotiated projects in visual arts practice. The purpose of this paper is to equip students with little previous art experience, or those who do have some experience in this subject, to engage in a negotiated, personal art investigation. The paper will allow students to learn processes for drawing for investigation and for the generation and development of art projects. It will introduce students to an appropriate range of media and technical processes in drawing, painting and an appropriate extension medium, and it will introduce students to the range of formal and conventional practices necessary to inform their own art making.The paper will also develop the skills necessary to investigate, analyse and evaluate the works of other artists in related contexts in ways that can contribute to the development of students' own art projects.",

Education serves a vital role in society and is often at the heart of public debate. This paper will introduce you to key social, cultural, historical, and political debates related to education in Aotearoa New Zealand. Through lectures, workshops, and readings, the paper provides students with provocations and tools to develop a critical and informed understanding of the complex and multiple roles of education in society. In particular, you will consider:Who should be educated, why, and who decides?How is education organised, developed, and debated in Aotearoa New Zealand?How does education respond to societal issues and work to include or exclude children and young people (based on culture, gender, sexuality, disability, and class)?Such critical understandings are a huge asset for everyone, especially if you are considering working as, or with, educators in the future.",

We explore contemporary feminist politics and debates. We introduce you to discourse analysis so you can critically analyse popular advice books that claim to know the best ways to 'bring up' girls and boys (assignment one). We explore a range of topics on creating gender-inclusive curriculum, pedagogy and policy, and 'queering' the curriculum, with lots of opportunities for debate and incorporation of media hot topics.The paper is all internally assessed. The major assignment allows you to research a gender topic of your choice. Students in the past have researched diverse topics such as gender representations in Disney movies, school textbooks, high school websites and children's picture books; others have even surveyed the toy aisles of the Warehouse. Once armed with your data, you will explore the implications for education. You are supported throughout all of the assignments to gain critical analytical skills and valuable research skills.

ENVI 211 examines the environmental history of New Zealand, with specific focus on the interaction between humans and their environment that has occurred since the arrival of humans about 800 years ago. As one of the last land masses to be settled by humans, and with endemic flora and fauna long isolated from evolutionary trajectories elsewhere, Aotearoa New Zealand is as an outstanding \"laboratory\" of environmental interaction. With two main pulses of settlement, it offers unique opportunities for comparative studies of human modifications of the environment and human responses to such change. Here we embed both colonial and indigenous perspectives of the environment, and how our shifting gaze and values of \"nature\" have changed over time, and how these ideals are codified in law. We are concerned with understanding human attitudes to their natural surroundings, human modifications of this environment, and human responses to these changes.",

Topics include labour force change, gendered production of consumer goods, fashion, retailing and the consumption of gender identities. This paper will provide an introduction to the relationships between gender, work (both paid and unpaid) and the emerging field of consumer culture studies. We examine why women and men often experience work differently. Consumer culture is the other side of the coin: patterns of spending the money we earn. As consumers we often rely on the work of ourselves and others, and we examine how consumer practices are also gendered. Specific topics include assumptions about work, emotional labour, the changing labour force, theories of work and consumption, shopping malls and the ambiguous spaces of suburbia. Students in GEND 306 conduct their own interview research project.",

This paper examines the political events of the period - those who ruled and by what means their power was upheld and reproduced - but focuses equally on social history and the lives of workers, peasants, families, communities, ethnic groups, men and women. This dual approach leads to the consideration of the major issues arising in Russian history.To what extent was Russian society different from that of Western Europe? Was the development of capitalism and parliamentary democracy possible in the late 19th and early 20th centuries? Why did the revolutions occur?",

International criminal law (ICL) has developed alongside international humanitarian law (the law of armed conflict), but ICL is unique in international law in that its principles apply directly to individuals, as opposed to states.The paper will examine the history, jurisdiction, structure and procedures of the International Criminal Court. Particular attention will be given to the four core crimes within the current or prospective jurisdiction of the Court: the crime of genocide, crimes against humanity, war crimes and the crime of aggression. In doing so, the origins, historical development, sources and content of substantive international criminal law will be surveyed.",

In New Zealand, the law in this field is found in the Commerce Act 1986, as amplified by decisions of the Commerce Commission and the courts. This paper examines the economic effects and legality of co-ordinated conduct, monopolisation and merger control.

It will be valuable to students from all disciplines and across all divisions. The course aims to provide an introduction to ethically responsible leadership with a focus on self-awareness of students' own values, strengths and weaknesses and on developing leadership skills for working in teams and diverse situations. The lecture series exposes students to a variety of theoretical and research-based leadership concepts and styles and looks at what it means to be a global citizen in todays\u2019 world.This is a course with a strong experiential focus \u2013 because leadership can\u2019t be learned from just textbooks or lectures. This course includes weekly tutorials which have a strong teamwork focus and will help develop a range of leadership, communication and conflict resolution skills. A major component of the course is the social action project which allows students to align with a community organisation or issue that they care about and work effectively to bring value to that organisation, whist simultaneously learning that even small pebbles can make large waves.Prospective students require enthusiasm, a desire to be an active citizen, a \u2018can-do\u2019 attitude and a commitment to their teams and community stakeholders. All classes are compulsory to ensure that students are fully committed to this service-learning opportunity, have the required skills and knowledge to work safely in the community and represent themselves and the University to the highest standards. Terms requirements apply. The course is designed to be interesting, motivating, at times challenging, but most of all, fun!",

The techniques covered in this paper form the basic tools used to produce mathematical frameworks for modelling quantifiable phenomena. For example, to model the movement of an object through space, we begin with an algebraic structure in which to specify where our object is, and then study how that position changes with time using methods developed in calculus. Many other problems arising in areas such as Economics or Chemistry can be examined mathematically using the same basic principles. For example, we may need to minimise a manufacturing cost, or the time for a chemical reaction to take place, or the effects of river pollution; in each case the techniques used for the minimisation are based on a mixture of tools relying on both algebra and calculus.This paper aims to develop proficiency with algebra and calculus, both for use in other subjects and in preparation for further study of Mathematics.

The main examples students have met in school and first-year university are from calculus, where the derivative and integral are defined using quite different limiting processes. Real analysis specialises to real-valued functions of a real variable. The methods of analysis have been developed over the past two centuries to give mathematicians rigorous methods for deciding whether a formal calculation is correct or not. This paper discusses the basic ideas of analysis. At the end of the semester, students should have a grounding in the methods of analysis which will prove invaluable in later years.",

    "description": "This paper is an introduction to the mathematics of curves, surfaces and volumes in three-dimensional space, and extends the notions of differentiation and integration to higher dimensions. Many scientists want to predict the future state of some system, be it the state of our universe, the state of our solar system, the state of an amoeba colony, the state of our economy, the state of a chemical reaction etc. The predictions are generally based on the relationship between the rate of change of the system and properties of the system environment. In many cases the actual quantities of interest depend not only on the passage of time, but on other factors as well, such as spatial variations of properties within the system and its environment. A prime example is our weather. The air pressure and the temperature change during the day and they are different in different parts of the world, so they change also in space.Multivariate differential calculus provides the fundamental tools for modeling system changes when more than one important parameter is responsible for those changes. It is particularly fundamental to all of the physical and natural sciences, and to all situations requiring the modeling of rates of change.In this paper, many of the ideas and techniques of one-variable differentiation and integration (as covered in MATH 160 and 170) are generalized to functions of more than one variable. The simplest case deals with functions of the form z = f (x, y), i.e., functions whose graph is a surface in three-dimensional space. Such surfaces can be drawn with the aid of level curves of the function. Paths of steepest ascent (or descent) along the surface may eventually lead to local or global extremum values of the function which generally have particular physical significance.Other important notions covered in the paper are vector fields (such as flow fields of a fluid) and their properties and the fundamental integral identities which express conservation laws, such as the conservation of energy and momentum in Physics or the conservation of mass in Chemistry.",

Modern algebra is studied all over the world, perhaps not surprisingly in view of its international beginnings in the late 1700s with work of the Swiss mathematician Leonhard Euler, the French mathematician Joseph Louis Lagrange, and the German mathematician Carl Friedrich Gauss. Their work led to the introduction in the 1800s of the unifying abstract algebraic concepts of a group and a ring, the first of these pioneered by Arthur Cayley, the second by Richard Dedekind. These two notions of a group (a set with a standard operation, usually called multiplication) and a ring (a set with two operations, usually called addition and multiplication) are very important in many of the sciences as well as mathematics in both its pure and applied branches. Even after more than 100 years since their introduction, most of today\u2019s research in modern algebra involves the study of either groups or rings (or both!)The learning aims of the paper are principally to develop the notions of groups and rings, to see how these arise in a variety of mathematical settings, and to establish their fundamental properties.

As these concepts aim to explain intergroup conflicts, which are multi-layered phenomena often appearing at the macro-level of society, we will discuss the boundaries of each concept and the challenges of how to study them appropriately.The paper will describe a full cycle: beginning with the outbreaks of conflicts and finishing with their resolution and peace-building through reconciliation processes.

A variety of examples from around the world are used to illustrate.This paper is 100% internally assessed.",

Why are poor countries of the world poor?

For practitioners, the challenge is to find ways to translate principles of recovery into everyday practice in meaningful ways whilst also negotiating the tensions it creates with a bio-medical perspective of mental disorder. This paper takes the view that contemporary mental health practice requires workers to assist people to develop a sense of mastery and control over their lives and as such is a practical application of recovery principles. To do this requires mental health workers to be creative and flexible in how they understand mental distress and to have the skills to work collaboratively with people to make meaning from their experiences. It also requires the critical exploration of the barriers that exist to achieving this at both the level of individual practice and organisational systems.",

For most students, this paper is their introduction to these strategies, and they enjoy the practical nature of this paper. Another important part and highlight of PSYC 406 is the presentation of cases by the fifth-year Clinical Psychology students. These provide insight and understanding into the cases that students are likely to experience the following year when they move into the Clinical Psychology Centre.",

Themes include secularism, religious freedom, pluralism and others. These days, it is almost impossible to open a newspaper or watch TV without learning about a conflict at the intersection of religion, law and politics. This paper invites students from all disciplines to look more closely at these conflicts and to reconsider the dominant ways we understand them. Through examining a variety of case studies from Asia, Europe, the US and NZ, this paper aims to give students the terms, ideas and confidence to intervene in these public debates about religion intelligently and cogently.",

Learn the theory and practice of making science public, including participatory science, outreach and public engagement events. Science communication is about bringing scientific knowledge to the public, but it's also about bringing the public's knowledge, concerns and interest to science. So how do we build the relationship between science and society? And how do we give the broader public a voice in scientific matters?In this paper, we focus on the participatory and public aspects of science communication, both in theory and practice as we look at some practical know-how for strengthening the relationship between science and society. Working with the University's Centre for Science Communication (one of the largest such graduate teaching centres in the world), we'll take you through various ways science can engage with the public, culminating in the running of a public science-engagement event.",

This gives you the opportunity to enhance skills in academic research, conceptual analysis, and in creative science communication. In this paper, you will learn about current research topics and research methods in science communication. You will see good examples of creative science communication projects and theses. If planning to produce a creative component, you will consider integration of the creative and research components of the thesis project.

The social theory we are interested in developing in this course is intimately entangled with the empirical experience of our everyday lives, which is the ground for creative and imaginative conceptual invention. We will endeavour to submit ourselves and the world around us \u2013 the social structures and processes which we inhabit \u2013 to vigorous questioning.

SPEX 102 Principles of Exercise for Health and Performance introduces exercise science and its disciplines (e.g., biomechanics) partly by considering common myths, misconceptions, and students' understanding of these. For example, what actually is exercise or fitness? Is exercise training necessary for fitness, and is fitness necessarily improved from training? What constitutes resistance or endurance exercise, and why do they improve fitness for health, work, or sport? Do training aids really aid fitness or performance? Does practice improve skill? How much practice, and what type? How would you know such things or test them yourself? Cultural and environmental contexts are also addressed. This paper would benefit anyone interested in exercise for human health or performance.",

The system is evolutionary and sometimes undergoes radical change, is changed in minor ways at other times and occasionally reintroduces matters that have been deleted by previous amendments. For this reason it is critical that students understand the way in which the New Zealand system has developed, the reasons for changes, what is new and what has been used before. This paper sets in place a knowledge of the fundamental aspects of the New Zealand planning process from first principles and explains the way it developed, including the introduction of the Resource Management Act 1991.",

Instruction will be given in the methodology of performing cadastral surveys such that students can conduct a straightforward land transfer survey in Landonline. Students will also be given instruction in the use of GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite System) in cadastral surveys and learn how to conduct limited as to parcels surveys. Students will gain problem-solving skills in the New Zealand cadastral context.This paper logically follows on from SURV 207 Cadastral Surveying 1, but concentrates on the definition skills required by the licensed cadastral surveyor and the presentation of datasets to Land Information NZ. It provides the practical application in cadastral surveys that support the varieties of land tenure introduced in SURV 206 and 306. It also forms a practical link with SURV 305 Statutory Planning in terms of the application of Territorial Authority consents related to cadastral surveys.",

This paper looks at a broad spectrum of land tenure issues ranging from boundaries to ways of securing rights in land, informal settlement (squatting) and community-based natural resource management. As the world population continues to climb, further pressure is being exerted on land, and an understanding of land tenure is increasingly important in poverty alleviation, housing provision and food security.

Writing a one-act (in THEA 241) and a long one-act (in THEA 341) are excellent exercises, but true full-lengths (75+ minutes) are far more useful for real-world application: many theatre companies are primarily interested in play submissions that warrant a full night out of theatre.",

Students will review, evaluate and debate the intellectual foundations and ideas of, and behind, archaeology. These ideas cover some of the most important intellectual developments in recent human history including feminism, postcolonial theory, and evolutionary and environmental theory. Students also consider important and influential theorists in archaeological history and the contemporary discipline of world archaeology.

Submission date for dissertations is Friday of the last teaching week in the second semester. The choosing of your topic is one of the most challenging and rewarding decisions that you will have to make in the whole exercise. It will depend on the kind of interests you have developed in Social Anthropology and the availability of supervisors with appropriate expertise. Please review the list of staff members and areas of interest on the Social Anthropology website. It is recommended that you consult with appropriate staff as soon as possible and before the end of your third year. If you have developed strengths in particular areas of your subject or become closely involved with certain courses, there would be considerable advantage in continuing with that work for your dissertation.One important consideration, and one reason for consulting closely with staff, is making sure that you select a topic that is practicable within the time available. The challenge here is selecting something that is going to make a satisfying and rewarding piece of research, but that will also be of such size and scope that you will be able to bring it to completion on time.In social anthropology, potential topics range from library-based studies based on primary and/or secondary sources, to research involving fieldwork using one or a number of the many different methods used in field research (for example, participant observation, formal interviews, unobtrusive methods). This is usually your first opportunity to carry out field research, and with the supervision that is provided by the Programme it will enable you to gain valuable first-hand experience in doing social research. Fieldwork involving human subjects requires ethical approval from the University Ethics Committee; your supervisor will advise you about this.",

The course is both practical and applied and is designed so participants develop skills which enable them to use Cognitive Behaviour Therapy (CBT) in their workplace. Establishing a firm theoretical knowledge base, it shows how CBT is used as a framework for assessing and gaining understanding of a patient's psychological distress and then formulating and implementing an intervention based on that conceptualisation.The course is an introduction to CBT, intended to teach the basic theory and strategies to a basic level of competence, i.e. able to work under supervision by a clinical psychologist, with easier to treat anxiety disorders, and depression, with some knowledge of working with people with psychosis and alcohol and drug problems.",

There is an emphasis on the technical, problem-solving phase of the food product development process and the project is set to simulate the time, cost, quality and process issues faced when working within a company to develop new products. Projects are solicited from food manufacturing companies or research organisations. Projects can range from the development of new products to reformulations or range extenders. All of the projects require the groups to produce a product in a \"market ready\", packaged form. Students need to go through the stages of concept development, prototype development, shelf-life assessment, consumer testing, packaging design and labelling.",

Key insights from the various fields within forensic biology to provide vital evidence in investigations of violent crime and disaster victim identification.The paper is designed as an introduction for the student who is interested in analysing the biological aspects of forensic science at the crime scene and in a laboratory. Students will have the unequalled opportunity to interact with a range of national and international forensic experts, providing a sense of reality and authority that is unique.The interactive practical sessions examine the entire process of conducting a forensic investigation, from the evidence at the mock \u2018crime scene\u2019, through the examination and evaluation of that evidence, to the story the media portray of violent crimes.Warning: The content and discussion in this paper will necessarily include many aspects of criminal death investigation. Some lectures and the reflective essay assessment may be emotionally challenging to engage with. The course coordinators will foster a teaching environment of respect and sensitivity, whilst thoughtfully and critically engaging with potentially disturbing content. Graphic and intense content will be highlighted during summer school lectures.",
